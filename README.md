a static page for computing humidity, sample temperature, and bath temperature for Matt Barrett's PhD Biophysics experiment

It uses the Antoine equation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_equation

Solutions can be given or calculated with degrees Celsius or with Kelvin.
Humidity should be entered in PERCENT form, not as a decimal (ex. 55% not .55)

Code written by Michele Guido with assistance from Fronx Wurmus and Tiffany Conroy. Equations supplied by Matt Barrett.
